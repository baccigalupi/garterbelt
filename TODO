anonymous views

view
  class level view required defaults to [] not nil
  join on widgets?
  pass block to render method so you can yield!
  better error messaging when rendering buffer, which line in content is causing the problem?
  script and style tags auto escape
  
renderers
  switch from erb to direct escaping of html
  make quotes not escape
  
partial
  pass the block content to partial instances too
  partial passes down params from parent view

page
  embed_js, embed_css file content, string content
  make content method = page_content, so that downstream views can just use content as their main method


name changes (for less name collision):
  options to initialization_options
  curator to _curator
  look at other names for possible issues
