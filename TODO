increase performance ~10%

anonymous views

view
  better error messaging when rendering buffer, which line in content is causing the problem?
  join on widgets?
  caching of full views

  partial
    pass the block content to partial instances too
    partial passes down params from parent view
  
renderers
  switch from erb to direct escaping of text
    make quotes not escape

page
  embed_js, embed_css file content, string content
  make content method = page_content, so that downstream views can just use content as their main method


name changes (for less name collision):
  options to initialization_options
  curator to _curator
  look at other names for possible issues
