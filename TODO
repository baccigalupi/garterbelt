anonymous views

view
  better error messaging when rendering buffer, which line in content is causing the problem?
  join on widgets?
  caching of full views

  partial
    --
  
renderers
  switch from erb to direct escaping of text
    make quotes not escape

page
  embed_js, embed_css file content, string content
  make content method = page_content, so that downstream views can just use content as their main method


name changes (for less name collision):
  curator to _curator
  look at other names for possible issues
