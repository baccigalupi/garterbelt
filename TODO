increase performance ~10%

partial passes down params from parent view
anonymous views
pass block to render method so you can yield!
join on widgets?
better error messaging when rendering buffer, which line in content is causing the problem?
text should ignore nil content
text wraps at X chars
class level view required defaults to [] not nil


name changes (for less name collision):
  options to initialization_options
  curator to _curator
  look at other names for possible issues
